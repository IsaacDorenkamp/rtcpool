# 3.0.0: February 17, 2022
- Refactored project and redesigned
  negotiation process to be 100% perfect.
  Previous versions came close but never
  to total accuracy.
- Updated to SDP Signalling Protocol V2

# 2.1.10: February 16, 2022
- Fixed ManagedStream constructor bug wherein
  this._streams[conn.id] was assigned to a new
  media stream instead of cstream

# 2.1.9: February 16, 2022
- Actually implemented first feature detailed in
  2.1.8 entry (edited code in wrong location).
- Added various helper methods for interacting with
  individual MediaStream objects.

# 2.1.8: February 16, 2022
- ManagedStream now creates a new MediaStream for each
  peer, as is intended (instead of passing the passed-in
  stream as before)
- Added "...streams" to addTrack in ManagedConnection

# 2.1.7: February 16, 2022
- The MediaStream passed into ManagedStream is now passed
  into all calls to addTrack, so that tracks may be
  identified by the stream they are a part of over the
  peer connection
- Fixed empty tracks getter in ManagedStream

# 2.1.6: February 16, 2022
- Muting/Unmuting fixed

# 2.1.3-2.1.5: February 16, 2022
- Transitional patches to fix muting/unmuting

# 2.1.1: February 16, 2022
- fixed breaking change where some functions
  were accessing ManagedConnections rather than
  RTCPeerConnections
- fixed bug where senders generated by adding tracks
  to new peers were not registered with ManagedStream's
  internal sender map

# 2.1.0: February 16, 2022
- mute and unmute now add/remove tracks from all
  RTCPeerConnections respectively rather than just
  toggling the enabled flag

# 2.0.2: February 16, 2022
- Patched incorrect variable name in connection.js

# 2.0.1: February 16, 2022

- Fixed a buggy call to _apply_candidates with no connection ID

# 1.3.0: February 10, 2022

- Implemented perfect negotiation
	* Previously, some negotiations could fail due to offer
	  collisions. This version implements perfect negotiation,
	  which provides a mechanism to gracefully resolve all
	  offer collisions.
- Added documentation
- Renamed 'RTCDataChannel' to 'BroadcastDataChannel' to clarify meaning
  and resolve conflict with native RTCDataChannel class.

# 1.2.2: February 8, 2022

- Added support for descriptions on join
	* Previously, there was a bug in which servers would not
	  send descriptions to new clients that joined. This was

	  of their peers which are now sent when they join.
