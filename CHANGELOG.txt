  to new peers were not registered with ManagedStream's
  internal sender map

  RTCPeerConnections respectively rather than just

# 1.3.0: February 10, 2022

- Implemented perfect negotiation
	* Previously, some negotiations could fail due to offer
	  collisions. This version implements perfect negotiation,
	  which provides a mechanism to gracefully resolve all
	  offer collisions.
- Added documentation

  and resolve conflict with native RTCDataChannel class.

	  of their peers which are now sent when they join.
